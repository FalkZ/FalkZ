Hey, there :wave:

I am Falk, a software developer currently studying computer science at Zurich University of Applied Sciences.

I am a passionate programmer steadily improving my skills and learning new concepts in programming. I am a big fan of the open & free web and opensource, as they are some of the greatest achievements of computer science in my opinion. My ambition is to write useful and delightful software. I especially like writing tooling and software that makes my life easier. I am also very interested in software architecture and language design.





### My favorite programming languages
- Typescript
- Rust
- Svelte (Yes I know, it's not really a language, but almost)
